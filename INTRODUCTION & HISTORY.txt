HISTORY OF JAVA
===============
    * Java is a high level(Plain English), robust(Bug free), object-oriented and
      secure programming language.
    * Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle)
      in the year 1995.
    * James Gosling with his team invented Java & hence
      known as the father of Java
    * Java is an island in Indonesia where the
      first coffee was produced (called Java coffee).
    * James Gosling suggested name "Java" while having a cup of coffee
      nearby his office. (First they taught of naming it as Oak but it was already registered name)
	* First Java Version Was Released in January 23,1996(JDK-1.0.2) also Called Java-1
     
PROPERTIES/FEATURES OF JAVA
===========================
    1.SIMPLE:Easy to learn and understand.
    2.OBJECT-ORIENTED :Organizes our software as a combination of different types of objects with both data and behavior.
    3.PORTABLE: We can carry the Java bytecode to any platform (WEB, Mobile Web or Apps no extra coding required)
    4.PLATFORM INDEPENDENT : Once compliled We can Run Java Program(bytecode) on any OS (Mac, Linux,Windows etc..,)
    5.SECURED:We can develop virus-free systems(Java has it's own runtime environment).
    6.ROBUST: Strong memory,management(Memory will be cleared automatically by garbage collector once done)&Exception handling
    7.ARCHITECTURE NEUTRAL:Java occupy same memory for both 32bit & 64bit machines but in C we have different memory requirement
    8.HIGH PERFORMANCE:Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages like python(because Java bytecode is "close"to native code
    9.MULTITHREADED:We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads(Parallel executions of many tasks)
    10.DISTRIBUTED:We can access any files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet(Eg: File Sharing over network or Anydesk).
    11.DYNAMIC:It supports the dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand.(All Classes are not loaded in one go)

APPLICATIONS OF JAVA /WHERE IT IS USED..?
=========================================
Where Java is used?
    Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
    Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.
    Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
    Mobile
    Embedded System :Embedded C House Automation 
    Smart Card
    Robotics
    Games, etc.
	
SOFTWARES USED FOR JAVA & LINKS
================================
 ORACLE(JDK-java developement kit)-VERSIONS LIKE jdk8,11,13,16,17,18,19 etc..,                    ECLIPSE(IDE-integrated developement environment)

HOW JAVA CODINGS RUN..?
=======================
COMPILER:(javac)
----------------
- A compiler is a translator that converts the high-level language into the machine language.
- High-level language is written by a developer and machine language can be understood by the processor.
- Check whether the program we wrote is according to Java Rules & Syntax.
- If Rules are followed then convert program to byte code(.class file / binary).
- If Rules are not followed throws proper message about the mistake we did.
- Compiler is used to show errors to the programmer.
- Converts Source code to Object Programs.


             
			 HIGH-LEVEL             --------------             MACHINE
			 LANGUAGE       ----->> \\ COMPILER // ------->>   LANGUAGE(byte codes/binary code i.e.., 0 & 1)
			 (BY:                     ----------               (BY:
			 DEVELOPER)                                         PROCESSOR)
			 
			 

JVM - JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE :
----------------------------
- JVM is a program responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an interpreter.
- JVM is the one that actually calls the main method (Starting point) present in a java code.
- It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed. 
- Its implementation is known as JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
- Function Of JVM :-
                       ->Loads code
                       ->Verifies code
                       ->Executes code
                       ->Provides runtime environment
					   
JRE - JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT :
--------------------------------
- JRE is an installation package that provides an environment to only run(not develop) the java program(or application)onto your machine.
- JRE Includes JVM + Other Support Libraries to java Program / Application

JDK - JAVA DEVELOPEMENT KIT :
-----------------------------
- JDK is a Kit that provides the environment to develop and execute(run) the Java program.
- JDK is a kit/Package that consists of mainly two things a)JRE  & b)Developement Tools (Like compiler, Help documents etc..,)

              [JDK
			 {Java 
			 Developement  ====> {JRE along with JVM} + {Compiler} + {Developement Tools} + {Other Libraries}
			  Kit}]

HEAP MEMORY :
-------------
- Heap Memory is used for Dynamic Memory Allocation of Java objects and 
  JRE classes that are created during the execution of a Java program.
